# Our Guidelines

## The Foundation <a href="#the-foundation" id="the-foundation"></a>

Having a foundation is important, it is what everything is built upon. Thus let’s go over what we expect while being a part of our community.

### Related to Our Members <a href="#related-to-our-members" id="related-to-our-members"></a>

The following is not permitted, being **hostile** to others’ opinions, to **confuse**, **mislead**, **scam**, posting **sexual** or **racism** related, **NSFW** content, **soliciting** in private messages, using a **voice changer**, **bypassing** such as a punishment, sharing **malicious links**, or simply **picking** on a member intentionally.

**Threatening** will not tolerated what-so-ever period. This includes to scare or to cause harm to others. A few other examples of this is DDoS/DoSing, and Doxing to release any kind of information about a member that is not public such as a steamID64.

We understand it might be funny trying to get a friend or even another member to attempt to break our rule(s) which we call **baiting** this is not permitted and it will simply lead to a uno reverse card against you.

Pulling a prank that involves acting as a staff member or a member, we call that **impersonating** and it is not permitted what-so-ever.

**Trading** any items outside of our community that have monetary value (Example: Ultra Shadow Stalker) is expressly prohibited! Citrus should not be considered as any kind of real-world currency equivalent.

### Related to Messaging

The following is not permitted, **zalgo** text, a **blank** name, **unusual unicode**, **political** views, a **attention** seeking name, an overly **lengthy** username.

Let’s say you just crafted your first Ultra Shadow Stalker, Celerate it! Make it known, use **all caps** even! Know, its okay to use all caps BUT, now this is a big BUT. Please don’t use them excessively thats all we ask.

How about you created a YouTube video on LYHME and now you are currently streaming on one of our servers, you are allowed to indeed **advertise** it! This can be setting your nickname to your Twitch or YouTube name, to even sharing the link inside one of our discord text-channels.

I gotta say we are known for not permitting **swearing**, so yes it is true. Swearing is not permitted! Including any of the associated acronyms. We do not count words such as damn, and hell as swear words.

A few topics that we ask not to talk about within our community is; **drugs**, **politics**, and **sexual talk** or **actions** via **roleplaying**.

We ask that you do not **spam** members while you are messaging and/or in a voice call, in some rare cases this is permitted.

If the topic ever arrises about **God** or anything related to **religion** we ask that you do not mock or disrespect it in any way.

On our servers, overall this won’t happen much but when it does, we call it “**hackusating**” what we mean by this is accusing a member of hacking via chat or voice. - When this happens, simply report it via our Discord.

When it comes to reporting, try to include much detail as possible!

{% hint style="info" %}
To report on our discord, you direct message our **ModMail** discord bot.

### Hacking and Scripting <a href="#hacking-and-scripting" id="hacking-and-scripting"></a>

As you might have guessed it, **hacking** or a **modified** client, **item duping**, auto **scripting**, self **bots** or **abuse** of anything that can be exploited is not permitted on any of our servers.
