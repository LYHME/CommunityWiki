### Becoming a Member of Our Team

The following are some steps and advice that you can follow.

**#1** Take your time answering the questions that you are asked.

* This goes along with while you apply, and being interviewed. Your answers are encouraged to be lengthy.

**#2** Actively TRY to help other members, inside our discord and in-game.

* When it comes to something you don't know, know its okay. You can take the moment to learn, let the member know you don't know and try to find someone that does.

**#3** Seek to get to know other BEAUTIFUL faces.

* This includes staff and also other members. BUT we do know that not everyone is out going and that is totally okay. Do it on your own time, if that is a simple "hi there" to a new member in discord that works.

**#4** Participate in the community.

* What we mean by this is, make suggestions, react to polls, changelogs and announcements.

**#5** Read over our wiki, learn where things are located.

* We are and will always be adding to our wiki, so this is important.

**#6** Patience.

* This includes our members, and staff team. When it comes to a application, It can take us 1 to 4 weeks to have it reviewed.

**#7** Report exploits, or something that needs to be cleaned up.

* You can report these things by contacting us via ModMail.

At the end of the day, please do everything you do because of your love for the Community. Not because you feel like you are being told what to do.
