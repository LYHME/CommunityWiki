## Becoming a Member of Our Team

So you'd like to become an LYHMECommunity, Staff Member. Awesome, let's get started.

#### Application Status: **OPEN**

In effect as of February 17, 2022

### Our Requirements

The following conditions must be met in order for you to apply

* At least 15 years old
* You are discord linked

### Applying

We provide the instructions inside our discord, `ðŸ“Œâ”‚announcements`text-channel.

## Recommendations

The following are some steps and advice that you can follow from Uncle LYHME.

<details>

<summary><strong>Time,  Helping and Participating</strong></summary>

Take your time answering questions that you are asked, this goes along with while you apply, and are being interviewed. We encouraged having your answers be lengthy.\
\
Actively **TRY** to help other members, inside our discord and even in-game. When it comes to something you don't know, know it's okay. You can take that moment to learn, let the member know you don't know, and try to find someone that knows the answer.

Participate in the community. What we mean by this is, to make suggestions, and react to polls, changelogs, and announcements to name a few.

<details>

<summary>Learning, Patience and Reporting</summary>

Read over our wiki, and learn where things are located. We are and will always be adding it, so this is very important.

Patience, to our members and staff team. When it comes to an application, It can take us 1 to 4 weeks to have it reviewed. It may not actually take the 4 weeks, but things can come up.

Report exploits, or something that needs to be cleaned up. You can report these things by contacting us via our ModMail bot.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Outgoing and Being YOU</strong></summary>

Seek to get to know other BEAUTIFUL members. This includes the team and also other members. BUT we also know that not everyone is outgoing and that is totally okay. Do it on your own time, if that is a simple "hi there" to a new member in discord that works.\
\
At the end of the day, please do everything you do because of your love for the Community. Not because you feel like you are being told what to do.
