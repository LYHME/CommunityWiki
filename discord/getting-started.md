# Getting Started

## Let's Get Started

Our Discord server, is our core server for everything when it comes to LYHME. To giveaways, announcements, polls and way more.

### Needing Support

When it comes to needing help, there are a few ways about doing it.

One way, is member driven. This could be quicker at times, it all depends. Checkout the `#ðŸ™‹â”Šneeding_help` text-channel where you can help others yourself, or ask questions that you might have.

The next way, is staff only. To get in contact, you will want to direct message our ModMail bot directly this will create a thread where you can communicate back and forth amung staff.
