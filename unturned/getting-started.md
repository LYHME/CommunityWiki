# Getting Started

## Let's Get Started <a href="#lets-get-started" id="lets-get-started"></a>

Your journey while being apart of our community is going to be very different and special compared to your usual Unturned community. Take this process slow, buckle up, because we have lots to cover.

### Important Infomation <a href="#important-infomation" id="important-infomation"></a>

When it comes to playing on our servers, there are a few things that we ask you to not do

Such as: \
Locking the **train**, you can't garage it - By following this it allows everyone else to ride to help get around the map.

Maps that have **NPCs** and/or **nodes** that have items to purchase with experience to later sell on our shop for Citrus (Aka Abusing It).

If you are attempting to try to get around the map, you don't need to **suicide** tons of times. Instead, ask in chat to see if someone is near and TPA to them.

**Raiding** attempts or **intentionally** placing items to **block** someone, including using **freeform** or other **buildable** objects to get to someone's base.

**Stealing** from other members such as a vehicle, item(s), private airdrop, or experience.

## Punishments <a href="#punishments" id="punishments"></a>

None of us are perfect, we all make mistakes. Heck as an owner I make mistakes quite often! That's okay though, when we do make them we own it, learn from it, and move forward.

### Ban Appealing <a href="#ban-appealing" id="ban-appealing"></a>

When we do make those mistakes we may have consequences. Sometimes they can last for a short or even a long period of time. Depending on the length of the consequence, you have the opportunity to appeal it.
