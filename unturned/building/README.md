# Building

## Guidelines When Building

Building is going to be a large part of your experience here, it is a way for you to express yourself and show off your accomplishments. Without these guidelines, we'd always be having to do map resets due to a decrease in performance. As you continue to read we will be going over these guidelines.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Before We Continue:** Buildables that are out of place.\
You will be banned for 4 hours for every buildable multiplied by the number of times you were banned within the latest map change. More than 25 buildables found the ban time will not be increased.
{% endhint %}

### Requirements

When you start to build your base, we ask everyone in our community to have one of the following items. Don't worry we will provide them for you. (via **/kit needs**)

| Required Items                               |
| -------------------------------------------- |
| **1x** Claim Flag                            |
| **1x** Locked Door / Sign                    |
| **1x** Bedroll, or Anything related to a BED |

**Claim Flag:** Placed anywhere in or out of your base! All items must be inside the radius, such as but not limited to crops, chairs, and fences. If you use fences, that is where the perimeter starts.

**The Sign:** Must be placed in the front of your base near the front door. Please have it be obvious, that is not hidden or covered. On the sign, it must contain all your group members' names including your own.

**Bed(s):** Claimed, helps if you want to get back to your base faster. `/home`

{% hint style="info" %}
Let's say we add a map, and the map has its own version of any of the content above and it serves the same purpose you are **permitted** to use that in place of the vanilla equivalent items.
{% endhint %}

### Size Limits

With our community we want it to be like a family, hence we try to encourage everyone to group at least with one other member. When you do this you are rewarded by being able to build a bigger base! Though it is not required to group up, we want to leave that option open to you.

| Number of Members        | Max Cubes |
| ------------------------ | :-------: |
| **Solo** Member          |     8     |
| **Two** Members          |     16    |
| **Three** Members        |     24    |
| **Four** & Above Members |     32    |

{% hint style="warning" %}
We define a **Group** as being two or more members.
{% endhint %}

### Decorating

We know it to be important to you, but the following are the limits of certain items.

## Questions & Answers

The following are questions that you might ask when it comes to building. If one isn't listed, reach out to us via our ModMail discord bot.

<details>

<summary>Where Can I Build?</summary>

We permit you to almost build anywhere! Such as underwater, in a windmill, a boat base and even inside a chicken coop. Note: Boat bases must look like boats or base must be connected to the ground.

As long as it follows our base requirements, and its not in an easter egg location.

Please have it be at least **75m** away from a town, safezone, or citrus treasure. This also includes away from other members, but if you get their permission to build closer then the recommended distance that is okay.

When it comes to sky bases, they are indeed permitted but it must touch the ground via the usage of foundation pillars.

You can use the **pointing gesture** to find out the distance from how far you are away from where you are standing to what you point at.

You can also change the code at any time, by doing the same command.
