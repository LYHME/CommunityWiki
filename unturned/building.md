# Building

## Guidelines When Building

Building is going to be a large part of your experience here, it is a way for you to express yourself and to show off your accomplishments. Without these guidelines, we'd always be having to do map resets due to a decrease in performance. As you continue to read we will be going over these guidelines.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Before We Continue:** Buildables that are out of place. You will be banned for 4 hours for every buildable multiplied by the amount of times you were banned within the latest map change. More than 25 buildables found the ban time will not be increased.
{% endhint %}

### Requirements

When you start to build your base, we ask everyone in our community to have one of the following items. Don't worry we will provide them for you. (via **/kit needs**)

| Required Items                               |
| -------------------------------------------- |
| **1x** Claim Flag                            |
| **1x** Locked Door / Sign                    |
| **1x** Bedroll, or Anything related to a BED |

{% hint style="info" %}
Let's say we add a map, and the map has its own version of any of the content above and it serves the same purpose you are **permitted** to use that in place of the vanilla equivalent items.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Claim Flag:** Placed anywhere in or out of your base! No more than **5m** away from the outside. All items must be inside the radius, such as but not limited to crops, chairs, and fences. The perimeter of a base counts from a fence. \
**Sign:** Place in the front of your base near the front door. Must be obvious, not hidden or covered. Also must contain all your group members names if applicant along with your own name. \
**Bed(s):** Claimed, in or out of your base.
{% endhint %}

### Size Limits

With our community we want it to be like a family, hence we try to encourage everyone to group at least with one other member. When you do this you are rewarded by being able to build a bigger base! Though it is not required to group up, we want to leave that option open to you.

Below is what we have set out for solo members and groups.

| Number of Members        | Max Cubes |
| ------------------------ | :-------: |
| **Solo** Member          |     8     |
| **Two** Members          |     16    |
| **Three** Members        |     24    |
| **Four** & Above Members |     32    |

{% hint style="warning" %}
We define a **Group** as being two or more members.
{% endhint %}

### Decorating

We know it to be important to you, but the following are the limits of certain items.

We do permit where you can place chairs and tables and other decorations on the top of your base.

We define a freeform being an item that rotates on a spherical axis.

{% hint style="warning" %}
\*This includes when an animal(s) are on display. \
\*\*We classify alcohol barrels as a part of this.

## All About Cubes

When it comes to building you may hear lots of talk about "cubes" and ask huh, what are those? Well, you are in luck! Below are a few images for visual examples of what we call a ½ cube, and 1 full cube.

### ½ Cube Examples

![The following are a few examples of a ½ cube.](../.gitbook/assets/blueprint-1-2cubeexamplesdraw.jpeg)

### 1 Full Cube Examples

![The following are a few examples of 1 full cube.](../.gitbook/assets/blueprint-1cubeexamplesdraw.jpeg)

### Putting It All Together

Now that you know what a ½ cube is along with 1 full cube, here are a few examples of 8, 16, and 32 cube bases.

### 8 Cube Base Examples

### 32 Cube Base Examples

**Important:**

We do have the rights to use the background commercially. We did not make the grid ourselves or remove the original watermark. Cedit to whoever did, however we did make the Blueprints themselves.
{% endhint %}

## Commands

**/distance on/off** - Toggle on and off how far something is away when using the point gesture.

## Questions & Answers

The following are questions that you might ask when it comes to building. If one isn't listed, reach out to us via our discord.

### What Are Some Building No No's?

Thank you for asking! We ask no **Rituals**, **Cruciftions**, or **violent images** of any kind aswell as **Hate speech**, **Symbols**, or **Terrorism**.

### Where Can I Build?

We permit you to almost build anywhere! Such as underwater, in a windmill, a boat base and even inside a chicken coop. Note: Boat bases must look like boats or base must be connected to the ground.

As long as it follows our base requirements, and its not in an easter egg location.

Please have it be at least **75m** away from a town, safezone, or citrus treasure. This also includes away from other members, but if you get their permission to build closer then the recommended distance that is okay.

When it comes to sky bases, they are indeed permitted but it must touch the ground via the usage of foundation pillars.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can use the **pointing gesture** to find out the distance from how far you are away from where you are standing to what you point at.
{% endhint %}

### Building Height?

We do not actually have a building height!

### Can I Build Above or On Road Ways?

You can build above (two cube above or more) to allow vehicles to pass, but building on them is not permitted.

### Member/Staff Build For Me?

Absolutely! They are indeed permitted to build for you if they would like.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Risk:** Them not being online for 7 days or more, no refunds provided.\
**Materials:** Can be requested, or charged for what is needed.\
**Payment:** They can seek one, if they wish but not required.
{% endhint %}

### Staff use Worldedit for me?

We do permit this to those that have this ability. ONLY if they want and they can charge Citrus for their time.

### Separate Structures?

Indeed! No more than **5m** apart, also must be in your claim flag area, and will count towards your total cube count.

### Could I Build a Town?

Absolutely! It is 100% permitted and we even encourage it. If you choose to do this, you are not exempted from any of our building guidelines. Though this does not include a PREMADE town, but rather one that you build.

### Giving Away Free Items

Craft and use any of the wooden crates, you can even place multiple! On each one place a sign in front of it, saying that it is free.

{% hint style="info" %}
This will make it where it's not counted as stealing.
{% endhint %}

### Better Way to Secure My Storages?

You can set a **four** digit number lock on any of your storage containers by looking at it and doing `/lock code`. An example of this would be `/lock 0401`.\
\
You can also change the code at any time, by doing the same command.

## Building on Vehicles

We do have some limits and restrictions when it comes to vehicle building.

| Item Topic         | Number Per Vehicle |
| ------------------ | :----------------: |
| Any Traps          |        2 Max       |
| Any Sentries       |        2 Max       |
| Light Sources      |        4 Max       |
| Storage Containers |        5 Max       |
| Displays           |       10 Max       |

{% hint style="info" %}
We do not permit beds to be placed on vehicles (try it, I dare you). We also do not recommend placing or storing valuable items on your vehicles due to there is a chance of it becoming lost with no refunds provided when you garage it.
{% endhint %}
