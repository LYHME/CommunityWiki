## Ways To Make Citrus

You might ask, "What are some of the **best** ways to make Citrus?" Well, here are a few ways that you can make Citrus.

Every 15 minutes you will receive your rank set salary. And when you first joined, you received Citrus!

### Voting

placeholder.

### Hordes

Doing hordes can be very enjoyable, let's have a chat about it!

When thinking of doing one, you are allowed to place it **anywhere** across the map! Though if you choose to build a structure, once you are finished please clean it up after to avoid being banned.

Private, soloing, and even public ones, we ask that you communicate in **WORLD** chat what you are doing to allow others to be in the know.

To the members that choose to "camp" near one,it is not permitted! You can be punished for choosing to do this. Please do not intervene and respect the member(s) wishes.

{% hint style="info" %}
We define **camping** as sitting, near or under one.
{% endhint %}

When the horde is over, the beacon will break and gear will drop. When this happens it will be up to the person that **placed** it, to decide who gets any of the gear.

To those that place the beacon, you have the responsibility to declare in **AREA** chat if any of the member(s) will get the loot including the amount per member will get. If failed to do this, the gear is declared free-for-all to those that participate.
